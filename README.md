# Genetic Algorithm
## Notes
- Investigate using different goals (e.g., highest velocity, furthest distance)
- Maybe use a central leaderboard for storing which student got the best result
- Allow people to export configurations and/or generations
- Maybe don't show every generation
- Important to be able to tell what is and isn't a good algorithm. Perhaps have a "bad" preset and an "okay" preset
- Allow them to write some of the functions themselves
- Perhaps a less advanced mode for GCSE/A-Level students. Bundled as .exe?
- Abstract away all the graphical stuff so the students can investigate just the GA code
- Ensure basic preset doesn't take too long to run
- Electron-esque window for config, SDL window for visuals?
